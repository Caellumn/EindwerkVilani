# Setting up SendGrid in Your Laravel Application

## Update Your .env File

Add these variables to your .env file:

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=apikey
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your_verified_email@example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Your Name"
```

Replace:
- `your_sendgrid_api_key_here` with your actual SendGrid API key
- `your_verified_email@example.com` with your verified sender email
- `Your Name` with your sender name

## How to Test

Visit `/test-sendgrid` in your browser to test sending the welcome email to argaenth@gmail.com.

## Important Notes

1. Make sure your sender email is verified in SendGrid
2. The API key needs "Mail Send" permissions
3. No folder structure has been changed - everything is using the original folder paths
